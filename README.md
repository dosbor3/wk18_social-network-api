# NoSQL Challenge Accepted!  Social Network API

MongoDB is a popular choice for many social networks due to its speed with large amounts of data and flexibility with unstructured data. 

This app is an API for a social network web application where users can share their thoughts, react to friends' thoughts, and create a friend list.  The app uses Express.js for routing, a MongoDB database, and the Mongoose ODM.  The app consists of timestamps that make use of the JavaScript date library, and the Date object
